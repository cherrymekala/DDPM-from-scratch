# DDPM-from-scratch

There are many different applications and types of diffusion models, but in this project I have focused on building a foundational unconditional diffusion model, DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models).I have built it from scratch in PyTorch.   I works based on Forward(Encoder) and Reverse(Decoder) process.It is based on UNET architecture.It is also having a noise/variance scheduler.So what are you waiting for, just take a dive into this model..!

**I'm hereby attaching the google colab link for this project:-** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bqhPo8_JihqbX7vDfzgZKNlINg_Xfb1s?usp=sharing

Note: This implementation was built for workflows that contain a single GPU with CUDA compatibility.
